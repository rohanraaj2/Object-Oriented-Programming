# Object-Oriented Programming

This repository contains a collection of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) tasks, assignments, and exercises completed across different courses, primarily using C++ and Python. The code covers a wide range of OOP concepts, from basic class design to advanced inheritance, polymorphism, and practical applications.

## C++ Coursework

Contains lab assignments, class activities, and various C++ programs demonstrating OOP concepts such as:
  - Classes and objects
  - Inheritance and polymorphism
  - Operator overloading
  - Dynamic memory management
  - Data structures (linked lists, queues)
  - Practical applications (calculators, toll booths, payment systems, etc.)

Each lab folder (Lab 01 to Lab 10) contains multiple `.cpp` files, each corresponding to a specific assignment or problem.

## Python Coursework

Contains Python projects and exercises focused on OOP, including:
  - **Car Racing Game:** Demonstrates class hierarchies, inheritance, and method overriding.
  - **Packaging Helper Tool:** Implements a class hierarchy for box packaging, including static methods and class attributes.
  - **Exercises:** Solutions to OOP practice problems (see [pynative.com](https://pynative.com/python-object-oriented-programming-oop-exercise/)).

Each subfolder contains a `README.md` with problem descriptions and instructions.

## Requirements

- **C++:** Any modern C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- **Python:** Python 3.x

No external libraries are required for most assignments.
